# Docker

This directory contains Docker and Docker Compose files for VAST and
integrations with related services.

> **Note**
> All examples shown use the [Docker Compose V2 CLI][docker-compose-v2-cli]. If
> using `docker compose` (with a space) does not work for you, try using
> `docker-compose` instead—although we don't test it explicitly, most commands
> should work that way as well.
