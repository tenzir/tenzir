# AI Agent Context for Tenzir

This document provides context and instructions for AI agents when working on
the Tenzir codebase.

## Project Overview

Tenzir is a low-code data pipeline solution that helps security teams to
collect, normalize, enrich, optimize, and route their data.

  - `tests/` - TQL test files and expected outputs
  - `services/` - System service configurations

## Key Tasks

### Setup

Make sure submodules are initialized and updated:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build

Configure the build:

```sh
cmake -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
```

Use `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` only when in need of advanced debugging.

Build the project as follows:

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Run pipelines

Use the `tenzir` binary to execute a TQL program:

- The first argument is the pipeline definition.
- Alternatively, pass the pipeline defintion as file via `-f <path>`.
- The pipeline may read stdin as data, based on the first operator.
- The pipeline may produce data on stdout, based on the last operator.

### Testing

Tenzir has both C++ *unit tests* and TQL *integration tests*.

#### Unit Tests

Run the unit tests via CTest:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build
```

#### Integration Tests

The integration tests are in `tenzir/tests`. Read `tenzir/tests/README.md` for
detailed instructions on how to exeucte and write tests.

TL;DR: run all integration tests via `uv`:

```sh
uv run tenzir/tests/run.py
```

Test the changed/new functionality selectively by passing the test files as
arguments, e.g.:

```sh
uv run tenzir/tests/run.py tenzir/tests/exec/drop/*.tql
```

### Code Quality

Tenzir maintains code quality through several mechanisms:

#### Code Formatting

- **C++ Code**: Uses clang-format with a custom `.clang-format` configuration
  - 2-space indentation
  - Attach braces style
  - Sorted includes with grouping
  - Run: `clang-format -i <file>` or use `scripts/clang-format-diff.py`

- **Python Code**: Uses Black formatter
  - Enforced in CI via `.github/workflows/style-check.yaml`
  - Configuration in `python/pyproject.toml`

#### CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/`:

- `style-check.yaml` - Enforces code formatting standards
- `tenzir.yaml` - Main CI pipeline for builds and tests
- `analysis.yaml` - Static analysis and security checks
- `docker.yaml` - Container image builds
- `release.yaml` - Release automation

#### Linting Tools

- **shellcheck** for shell scripts (via `scripts/shellcheck.bash`)
- **clang-tidy** for C++ static analysis (when enabled)

#### Additional Tools

- `scripts/` directory contains various development utilities:
  - `git-setup.sh` - Git hooks and configuration
  - `regression-tests.sh` - Regression testing
  - Platform-specific dependency installers

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow the existing code style and conventions.
2. Write integration tests for new TQL features, such as functions and
   operators.
3. Update documentation when adding new features
4. Create a changelog entry for new features, bugfixes, or changes using
   `changelog/add.py` before creating a PR. Write changelog entries like
   micro blog postsâ€”always include examples to illustrate the feature or fix.
   Format Markdown files with 80-character line lengths. For TQL examples:
   - Use ```tql blocks for both input pipelines and output
   - Show realistic, practical examples that demonstrate the feature
   - Include output that shows what users will actually see
   
   **Changelog titles should be user-focused**: Write titles that describe
   the functionality from a user's perspective, not the technical
   implementation. For example:
   - Good: "Dropping null fields" (describes what users can do)
   - Bad: "Add drop_null_fields operator" (describes technical implementation)
