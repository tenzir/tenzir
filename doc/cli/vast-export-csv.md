The `export csv` command renders [comma-seperatated
values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) in tabular form.
The first line in a CSV file contains a header that describes the field names.
The remaining lines contain concrete values. Except for the header, one line
corresponds to one event.
