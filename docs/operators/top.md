Shows the most common values.

```tql
top x:field
```

## Description

Shows the most common values for a given field. For each value, a new event
containing its count will be produced. In general, `top x` is equivalent to:

```tql
summarize x, count=count()
sort -count
```

This operator is the dual to [`rare`](/reference/operators/rare).

:::note[Potentially High Memory Usage]
Use caution when applying this operator to large inputs. It currently buffers
all data in memory. Out-of-core processing is on our roadmap.

top x
```

```tql
{x: "A", count: 3}
{x: "B", count: 2}
{x: "C", count: 2}
{x: "D", count: 1}
