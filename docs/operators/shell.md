shell cmd:string
```

## Description

The `shell` operator executes the provided command by spawning a new process.
The input of the operator is forwarded to the child's standard input. Similarly,
the child's standard output is forwarded to the output of the operator.

### `cmd: string`

The command to execute and hook into the pipeline processing. It is interpreted
by `/bin/sh -c`.

:::tip[Lots of escaping?]
Try using raw string literals: `r#"echo "i can use quotes""#`.
