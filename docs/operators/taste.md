Limits the input to `n` events per unique schema.

```tql
taste [n:int]
```

## Description

Forwards the first `n` events per unique schema and discards the rest.

The `taste` operator provides an exemplary overview of the "shape" of the data
described by the pipeline. This helps to understand the diversity of the
result, especially when interactively exploring data.

### `n: int (optional)`

The number of events to keep per schema.

Defaults to `10`.

## Examples

### Retrieve at most 10 events of each unique schema

```tql
export
taste
```

### Get only one sample for every unique event type

```tql
export
taste 1
```
