Keeps only events for which the given predicate is true.

```tql
where predicate:bool
```

## Description

The `where` operator only keeps events that match the provided predicate and
discards all other events. Only events for which it evaluates to `true` pass.

## Examples

### Keep only events where `src_ip` is `1.2.3.4`

```tql
where src_ip == 1.2.3.4
```

### Use a nested field name and a temporal constraint on the `ts` field

```tql
where id.orig_h == 1.2.3.4 and ts > now() - 1h
```

### Combine subnet, size and duration constraints

```tql
where src_ip in 10.10.5.0/25 and (orig_bytes > 1Mi or duration > 30min)
```
