Retrieves diagnostic events from a Tenzir node.

```tql
diagnostics [live=bool, retro=bool]
```

## Description

The `diagnostics` operator retrieves diagnostic events from a Tenzir
node.

:::tip[Retention Policy]
Set the `tenzir.retention.diagnostics` configuration option to change how long
Tenzir Nodes store diagnostics:

```yaml
tenzir:
  retention:
    diagnostics: 30d
```

:::

### `live = bool (optional)`

If `true`, emits diagnostic events as they are generated in real-time. Unless
`retro=true` is also given, this makes it so that previous diagnostics events
are not returned.

### `retro = bool (optional)`

Return diagnostic events that were generated in the past. Unless `live=true` is
given, this is the default. If both are set to `true`, all previous events are
returned before beginning with the live events.

## Schemas

Tenzir emits diagnostic information with the following schema:

### `tenzir.diagnostic`

Contains detailed information about the diagnostic.

| Field         | Type           | Description                                                                                |
