## Description

The `plugins` operator shows all available plugins and built-ins.

Tenzir is built on a modular monolith architecture. Most features are available
as plugins and extensible by developers. Tenzir comes with a set of built-ins
and bundled plugins. The former use the plugin API but are available as part of
the core library, and the latter are plugins shipped with Tenzir.

## Schemas

Tenzir emits plugin information with the following schema.

### `tenzir.plugin`

Contains detailed information about the available plugins.

|Field|Type|Description|
|:-|:-|:-|
|`name`|`string`|The unique, case-insensitive name of the plugin.|
|`version`|`string`|The version identifier of the plugin, or `bundled` if the plugin has no version of its own.|
|`kind`|`string`|The kind of plugin. One of `builtin`, `static`, or `dynamic`.|
|`types`|`list<string>`|The interfaces implemented by the plugin, e.g., `operator` or `function`.|
|`dependencies`|`list<string>`|Plugins that must be loaded for this plugin to function.|
