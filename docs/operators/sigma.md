Filter the input with Sigma rules and output matching events.

```tql
sigma path:string, [refresh_interval=duration]
```

## Description

The `sigma` operator executes [Sigma rules](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) on
its input. If a rule matches, the operator emits a `tenzir.sigma` event that
wraps the input record into a new record along with the matching rule. The
operator discards all events that do not match the provided rules.

<summary> Transpilation Process </summary>

For each rule, the operator transpiles the YAML into an
[expression](/reference/language/expressions) and instantiates a [`where`](/reference/operators/where)
operator, followed by assignments to generate an output. Here's how the
transpilation works. The Sigma rule YAML format requires a `detection` attribute
that includes a map of named sub-expression called *search identifiers*. In
addition, `detection` must include a final `condition` that combines search
identifiers using boolean algebra (AND, OR, and NOT) or syntactic sugar to
reference groups of search expressions, e.g., using the `1/all of *` or plain
wildcard syntax. Consider the following `detection` embedded in a rule:

```yaml
detection:
  foo:
    a: 42
    b: "evil"
  bar:
    c: 1.2.3.4
  condition: foo or not bar
```

We translate this rule piece by building a symbol table of all keys (`foo` and
`bar`). Each sub-expression is a valid expression in itself:

1. `foo`: `a == 42 && b == "evil"`
2. `bar`: `c == 1.2.3.4`

Finally, we combine the expression according to `condition`:

```tql
(a == 42 && b == "evil") || ! (c == 1.2.3.4)
```

We parse the YAML string values according to Tenzir's richer data model, e.g.,
the expression `c: 1.2.3.4` becomes a field named `c` and value `1.2.3.4` of
type `ip`, rather than a `string`. Sigma also comes with its own [event
taxonomy](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification/blob/main/Taxonomy_specification)
to standardize field names. The `sigma` operator currently does not normalize
fields according to this taxonomy but rather takes the field names verbatim from
the search identifier.

</details>

Sigma uses [value
modifiers](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification/blob/main/Sigma_specification.md#value-modifiers)
to select a concrete relational operator for given search predicate. Without a
modifier, Sigma uses equality comparison (`==`) of field and value. For example,
the `contains` modifier changes the relational operator to substring search, and
the `re` modifier switches to a regular expression match. The table below shows
what modifiers the `sigma` operator supports, where ‚úÖ means implemented, üöß not
yet implemented but possible, and ‚ùå not yet supported:

| Modifier         | Use                                                      | sigmac | Tenzir |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | :----: | :----: |
| `contains`       | perform a substring search with the value                |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `startswith`     | match the value as a prefix                              |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `endswith`       | match the value as a suffix                              |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `base64`         | encode the value with Base64                             |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `base64offset`   | encode value as all three possible Base64 variants       |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `utf16le`/`wide` | transform the value to UTF16 little endian               |   ‚úÖ   |   üöß   |
| `utf16be`        | transform the value to UTF16 big endian                  |   ‚úÖ   |   üöß   |
| `utf16`          | transform the value to UTF16                             |   ‚úÖ   |   üöß   |
| `re`             | interpret the value as regular expression                |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `cidr`           | interpret the value as a IP CIDR                         |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `all`            | changes the expression logic from OR to AND              |   ‚úÖ   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `lt`             | compare less than (`<`) the value                        |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `lte`            | compare less than or equal to (`<=`) the value           |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `gt`             | compare greater than (`>`) the value                     |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `gte`            | compare greater than or equal to (`>=`) the value        |   ‚ùå   |   ‚úÖ   |
| `expand`         | expand value to placeholder strings, e.g., `%something%` |   ‚ùå   |   ‚ùå   |

### `path: string`

The rule to match.

If `path` points to a rule, the operator transpiles the rule file at the time of
pipeline creation.

If this points to a directory, the operator watches it and attempts to parse
each contained file as a Sigma rule. The `sigma` operator matches if *any* of
the contained rules match, effectively creating a disjunction of all rules
inside the directory.

### `refresh_interval = duration (optional)`

How often the `sigma` operator looks at the specified rule or directory of rules
to update its internal state.

Defaults to `5s`.

## Examples

### Apply a Sigma rule to an EVTX file

The tool [`evtx_dump`](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx) turns an EVTX file
into a JSON object. On the command line, use the `tenzir` binary to pipe the
`evtx_dump` output to a Tenzir pipeline using the `sigma` operator:

```bash
evtx_dump -o jsonl file.evtx | tenzir 'read_json | sigma "rule.yaml"'
```

### Run a Sigma rule on historical data

Apply a Sigma rule over historical data in a node from the last day:

```tql
export
where ts > now() - 1d
sigma "rule.yaml"
```

### Stream a file and apply a set of Sigma rules to it

Watch a directory of Sigma rules and apply all of them on a continuous stream of
Suricata events:

```tql
load_file "eve.json", follow=true
read_suricata
sigma "/tmp/rules/"
```

When you add a new file to `/tmp/rules`, the `sigma` operator transpiles it and
will match it on all subsequent inputs.
