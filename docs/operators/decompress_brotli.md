The `decompress_brotli` operator decompresses bytes in a pipeline incrementally.
The operator supports decompressing multiple concatenated streams
of the same codec transparently.

## Examples

### Import Suricata events from a Brotli-compressed file

```tql
load_file "eve.json.brotli"
decompress_brotli
read_suricata
import
```
