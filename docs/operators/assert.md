Drops events and emits a warning if the invariant is violated.

```tql
assert invariant:bool
```

## Description

The `assert` operator asserts that `invariant` is `true` for events. In case an
event does not satisfy the invariant, it is dropped and a warning is emitted.

:::tip[Consider using `where` instead]
If you only want to filter events, use `where` instead of `assert`. The `where`
operator does not emit a warning when the expression evaluates to false, hence
it is more suitable for normal filtering purposes. It is also much faster than
`assert` in some situations due to optimizations such as predicate pushdown.

## Examples

### Make sure that `x != 2`

```tql
from {x: 1}, {x: 2}, {x: 3}
assert x != 2
```

```tql
{x: 1}
// warning: assertion failure
{x: 3}
```

### Check that a topic only contains certain events

```tql
subscribe "network"
assert @name == "ocsf.network_activity"
// continue processing
```
