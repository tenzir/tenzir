Loads bytes from a TCP or TLS connection.

```tql
load_tcp endpoint:string, [parallel=int, peer_field=field, tls=bool,
                           cacert=string, certifle=string,
                           max_buffered_chunks=int { … }]
```

## Description

Reads bytes from the given endpoint via TCP or TLS.

### `endpoint: string`

The endpoint at which the server will listen. Must be of the form
`[tcp://]<hostname>:<port>`. Use the hostname `0.0.0.0` to accept connections on
all interfaces.

### `parallel = int (optional)`

Number of threads to use for reading from connections.

Defaults to 1.

import TLSOptions from '../../.../../../../partials/operators/TLSOptions.mdx';

### `peer_field = field (optional)`

Write a record with the fields `ip`, `port`, and `hostname` resembling the peer
endpoint of the respective TCP connection into the specified field at the end of
the nested pipeline.

<TLSOptions tls_default="false"/>

### `max_buffered_chunks = int (optional)`

Maximum number of buffered chunks per connection.

Defaults to 10.

### `{ … } (optional)`

The pipeline to run for each individual TCP connection. If none is specified, no
transformations are applied to the output streams. Unless you are sure that
there is at most one active connection at a time, it is recommended to specify a
pipeline that parses the individual connection streams into events, for instance
`{ read_json }`. Otherwise, the output can be interleaved.

## Examples

### Listen for incoming Syslog over TCP

Listen on all network interfaces, parsing each individual connection as syslog:

```tql
load_tcp "0.0.0.0:8090" { read_syslog }
```

### Connect to a remote endpoint and read JSON

```tql
// We know that there is only one connection, so we do not specify a pipeline.
load_tcp "example.org:8090", connect=true
read_json
```

### Listen on localhost with TLS enabled

Wait for connections on localhost with TLS enabled, parsing incoming JSON
streams according to the schema `"my_schema"`, forwarding no more than 20 events
per individual connection:

```tql
load_tcp "127.0.0.1:4000", tls=true, certfile="key_and_cert.pem", keyfile="key_and_cert.pem" {
  read_json schema="my_schema"
  head 20
}
```

This example may use a self-signed certificate that can be generated like this:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key_and_cert.pem -out key_and_cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

You can test the endpoint locally by issuing a TLS connection:

```bash
openssl s_client 127.0.0.1:4000
```
