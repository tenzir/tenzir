Sends events to a Splunk [HTTP Event Collector (HEC)][hec].

```

## Description

The `to_splunk` operator sends events to a Splunk [HTTP Event Collector
(HEC)][hec].

The source type defaults to `_json` and the operator renders incoming events as
JSON. You can specify a different source type via the `sourcetype` option.

The operator accumulates multiple events before sending them as a single
message to the HEC endpoint. You can control the maximum message size via the
`max_content_length` and the timeout before sending all accumulated events via
the `send_timeout` option.

### `url: string`

The address of the Splunk indexer.

### `hec_token = string`

The [HEC
token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.3.1/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token_on_Splunk_Cloud_Platform)
for authentication.

### `event = any (optional)`

The event to send.

Defaults to `this`, meaning the entire event is sent.

### `host = string (optional)`

An optional value for the [Splunk `host`](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Host).

### `source = string (optional)`

An optional value for the [Splunk `source`](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Source).

### `sourcetype = expr (optional)`

An optional expression for [Splunk's
`sourcetype`](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Sourcetype) that evaluates to a
`string`. You can use this to set the `sourcetype` per event, by providing a
field instead of a string.

Regardless of the chosen `sourcetype`, the event itself is passed as a json object
in `event` key of level object that is sent.

Defaults to `_json`.

### `index = expr (optional)`

An optional expression for the [Splunk
`index`](https://docs.splunk.com/Splexicon:Index) that evaluates to a `string`.

If you do not provide this option, Splunk will use the default index.

**NB**: HEC silently drops events with an invalid `index`.

import TLSOptions from '../../.../../../../partials/operators/TLSOptions.mdx';

<TLSOptions tls_default="true"/>

### `include_nulls = bool (optional)`

Include fields with null values in the transmitted event data. By default, the
operator drops all null values to save space.

### `max_content_length = int (optional)`

The maximum size of the message uncompressed body in bytes. A message may consist of multiple events.
If a single event is larger than this limit, it is dropped and a warning is emitted.

This corresponds with Splunk's
[`max_content_length`](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.3.1/Admin/Limitsconf#.5Bhttp_input.5D)
option. Be aware that [Splunk Cloud has a default of
`1MB`](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/SplunkCloud/9.2.2406/Service/SplunkCloudservice#Using_HTTP_Event_Collector_.28HEC.29)
for `max_content_length`.

Defaults to `5Mi`.

### `buffer_timeout = duration (optional)`

The maximum amount of time for which the operator accumulates messages before
sending them out to the HEC endpoint as a single message.

Defaults to `5s`.

### `compress = bool (optional)`

Whether to compress the message body using standard gzip.

Defaults to `true`.

## Examples

### Send a JSON file to a HEC endpoint

```tql
load_file "example.json"
read_json
to_splunk "https://localhost:8088", hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
```

### Data Dependent Splunk framing

By default, the `to_splunk` operator sends the entire event as the `event` field
to the HEC, together with any optional Splunk "frame" fields such as `host`,
`source`, `sourcetype` and `index`. These special properties can be set using
the operators respective arguments, with an expression that is evaluated per event.

However, this means that these special properties may be transmitted as both part
of `event` and as part of the Splunk frame. This can be especially undesirable
when the events are supposed to adhere to a specific schema, such as OCSF.

In this case, you can specify the additional `event` option to specify which part
of the incoming event should be sent as the event.

```tql
from {
  host: "my-host",
  source: "my-source",
  a: 42,
  b: 0,
  message: "text",
  nested: { x: 0 },
}

// move the entire event into `event`
this = { event: this }

// hoist the splunk specific fields back out, so they are no longer part of the
// sent event
move host = event.host, source = event.source

to_splunk "https://localhost:8088",
  hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token"),
  host=host,
  source=source,
  event=event
```
