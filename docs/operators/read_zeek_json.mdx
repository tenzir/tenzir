example: 'read_zeek_json'
---

Parse an incoming Zeek JSON stream into events.

```tql
read_zeek_json [schema_only=bool, raw=bool]
```

## Description

import RawOption from '../../.../../../../partials/ParsingOptionRaw.mdx';
import SchemaOnlyOption from '../../.../../../../partials/ParsingOptionSchemaOnly.mdx'

<SchemaOnlyOption />

<RawOption />

This means that JSON numbers will be parsed as numbers,
but every JSON string remains a string, unless the field is in the `schema`.

## Examples

### Load a Zeek connection log
