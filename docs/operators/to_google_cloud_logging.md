## Example

## Send logs, authenticating automatically via ADC

```tql
from {
  content: "log message",
  timestamp: now(),
}
to_google_cloud_logging log_id="LOG_ID", project="PROJECT_ID"
```

## Send logs using a service account

```tql
from {
  content: "totally not a made up log",
  timestamp: now(),
  resource: "global",
