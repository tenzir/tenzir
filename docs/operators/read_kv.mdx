Read Key-Value pairs from a byte stream.

```tql
read_kv [field_split=string, value_split=string, merge=bool, raw=bool, quotes=string,
         schema=string, selector=string, schema_only=bool, unflatten_separator=string]
```

## Description

The `read_kv` operator transforms a byte stream into a event stream by parsing
the bytes as Key-Value pairs.

Incoming strings are first split into fields according to `field_split`. This
can be a regular expression. For example, the input `foo: bar, baz: 42` can be
split into `foo: bar` and `baz: 42` with the regular expression `r",\s*"`
(a comma, followed by any amount of whitespace) as the field splitter.
Note that the matched separators are removed when splitting a string.

Afterwards, the extracted fields are split into their key and value by
`value_split`, which can again be a regular expression. In our example,
`r":\s*"` could be used to split `foo: bar` into the key `foo` and its value
`bar`, and similarly `baz: 42` into `baz` and `42`. The result would thus be
`{"foo": "bar", "baz": 42}`. If the regex matches multiple substrings, only the
first match is used.

The supported regular expression syntax is
[RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). In particular, this means that
lookahead `(?=...)` and lookbehind `(?<=...)` are not supported by `read_kv` at the
moment. However, if the regular expression has a capture group, it is assumed
that only the content of the capture group shall be used as the separator. This
means that unsupported regular expressions such as `(?=foo)bar(?<=baz)` can be
effectively expressed as `foo(bar)baz` instead.

### Quoted Values

The parser is aware of double-quotes (`"`). If the `field_split` or
`value_split` are found within enclosing quotes, they are not considered
matches. This means that both the key and the value may be enclosed in
double-quotes.

For example, given `field_split` `\s*,\s*` and `value_split` `=`, the input

```
"key"="nested = value",key2="value, and more"
```
will parse as
```tql
{
  key: "nested = value",
  key2: "value, and more",
}
```

### `field_split = string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate individual fields.

Defaults to `r"\s"`.

### `value_split = string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate a key from its value.

Defaults to `"="`.

### `quotes = string (optional)`

A string of not escaped characters that are supposed to be considered as quotes.

Defaults to the characters `"'`.

## Examples

### Read comma-separated key-value pairs

```txt title="Input"
surname:"John Norman", family_name:Smith, date_of_birth: 1995-05-26
```

```tql title=" "
read_kv field_split=r"\s*,\s*",
  value_split=r"\s*:\s*"
```
```tql
{
  surname: "John Norman",
  family_name: "Smith",
  date_of_birth: 1995-05-26,
}
```

### Extract key-value pairs with more complex rules

```txt title="Input"
PATH: C:\foo INPUT_MESSAGE: hello world
PATH: D:\bar VALUE: 42 INFO: Great
```

```tql title=" "
read_kv field_split=r"(\s+)[A-Z][A-Z_]+:",
  value_split=r":\s*"
```
```tql
{
  PATH: "C:\\foo",
  INPUT_MESSAGE: "hello world",
}
{
  PATH: "D:\\bar",
  VALUE: 42,
  INFO: "Great",
}
```

This requires lookahead because not every whitespace acts as a field separator.
Instead, we only want to split if the whitespace is followed by `[A-Z][A-Z_]+:`,
i.e., at least two uppercase characters followed by a colon. We can express this
as `"(\s+)[A-Z][A-Z_]+:"`, which yields `PATH: C:\foo` and `INPUT_MESSAGE: hello
world`. We then split the key from its value with `":\s*"`. Since only the first
match is used to split key and value, this leaves the path intact.
