Saves bytes to a TCP or TLS connection.

```tql
save_tcp endpoint:string, [retry_delay=duration, max_retry_count=int,
                           tls=bool, cacert=string, certifle=string,
                           keyfile=string, skip_peer_verification=bool]
```

## Description

Saves bytes to the given endpoint via TCP or TLS. Attempts to reconnect
automatically for `max_retry_count` in case of recoverable connection
errors.

:::note
Due to the nature of TCP a disconnect can still lead to lost and or incomplete
events on the receiving end.
:::

### `endpoint: string`

The endpoint to which the server will connect. Must be of the form
`[tcp://]<hostname>:<port>`. You can also use an IANA service name instead
of a numeric port.

### `retry_delay = duration (optional)`

The amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect in case a connection
attempt fails and the error is deemed recoverable. Defaults to `30s`.

### `max_retry_count = int (optional)
The number of retries to attempt in case of connection errors before
transitioning into the error state. Defaults to `10`.

## Examples

### Transform incoming Syslog to BITZ and save over TCP

```tql
load_tcp "0.0.0.0:8090" { read_syslog }
write_bitz
save_tcp "127.0.0.1:4000"
```

### Save to localhost with TLS

```tql
subscribe "feed"
write_json
save_tcp "127.0.0.1:4000", tls=true, skip_peer_verification=true
```
