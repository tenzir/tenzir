Sends events via Fluent Bit.

```tql
to_fluent_bit plugin:string, [options=record, fluent_bit_options=record,
              tls=record]
```

## Description

The `to_fluent_bit` operator acts as a bridge into the [Fluent
Bit](https://docs.fluentbit.io) ecosystem, making it possible to send events to
Fluent Bit [output plugin][outputs].

[outputs]: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs

An invocation of the `fluent-bit` commandline utility

```bash
fluent-bit -o plugin -p key1=value1 -p key2=value2 -p…
```

translates to our `to_fluent_bit` operator as follows:

```tql
to_fluent_bit "plugin", options={key1: value1, key2:value2, …}
```

:::tip[Read from Fluent Bit]
You can acquire events from Fluent Bit using the [`from_fluent_bit` operator](/reference/operators/from_fluent_bit).
:::

### `plugin: string`

The name of the Fluent Bit plugin.

Run `fluent-bit -h` and look under the **Outputs** section of the
help text for available plugin names. The web documentation often comes with an
example invocation near the bottom of the page, which also provides a good idea
how you could use the operator.

### `options = record (optional)`

Sets plugin configuration properties.

The key-value pairs in this record are equivalent to `-p key=value` for the
`fluent-bit` executable.

### `fluent_bit_options = record (optional)`

Sets global properties of the Fluent Bit service. E.g., `fluent_bit_options={flush:1, grace:3}`.

Consult the list of available [key-value pairs][service-properties] to configure
Fluent Bit according to your needs.

[service-properties]: https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/administration/configuring-fluent-bit/classic-mode/configuration-file#config_section

We recommend factoring these options into the plugin-specific `fluent-bit.yaml`
so that they are independent of the `fluent-bit` operator arguments.

import TLSOptions from '../../.../../../../partials/operators/TLSOptions.mdx';

<TLSOptions tls_default="false"/>

## URI support & integration with `from`

The `to_fluent_bit` operator can also be used from the [`to`](/reference/operators/to)
operator. For this, the `fluentbit://` scheme can be used. The URI is then translated:

```tql
to "fluentbit://plugin"
```
```tql
to_fluent_bit "plugin"
```

## Examples

### Slack

Send events to [Slack](https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs/slack):

```tql
let $slack_hook = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
to_fluent_bit "slack", options={webhook: $slack_hook}
```
