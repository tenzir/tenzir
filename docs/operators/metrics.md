title: metrics
category: Node/Inspection
example: 'metrics "cpu"'
---

Retrieves metrics events from a Tenzir node.

```tql
metrics [name:string, live=bool, retro=bool]
```

## Description

The `metrics` operator retrieves metrics events from a Tenzir node. Metrics
events are collected every second.

:::tip[Retention Policy]
Set the `tenzir.retention.metrics` configuration option to change how long
Tenzir Nodes store metrics:

```yaml
tenzir:
  retention:
    metrics: 7d
```

:::

### `name: string (optional)`

Show only metrics with the specified name. For example, `metrics "cpu"` only shows
CPU metrics.

### `live = bool (optional)`

Work on all metrics events as they are generated in real-time instead of on
metrics events persisted at a Tenzir node.

### `retro = bool (optional)`

Work on persisted diagnostic events (first), even when `live` is given.

## Schemas

Tenzir collects metrics with the following schemas.

### `tenzir.metrics.api`

Contains information about all accessed API endpoints, emitted once per second.

| `timestamp`     | `time`     | The time at which the API request was received.        |
| `request_id`    | `string`   | The unique request ID assigned by the Tenzir Platform. |
| `method`        | `double`   | The HTTP method used to access the API.                |
| `path`          | `double`   | The path of the accessed API endpoint.                 |

| `params`        | `record`   | The API endpoints parameters passed inused.            |

The schema of the record `params` depends on the API endpoint used. Refer to the
[API documentation](/reference/node-api) to see the available parameters per endpoint.

### `tenzir.metrics.caf`

Contains metrics about the CAF (C++ Actor Framework) runtime system.

:::warning[Aimed at Developers]
CAF metrics primarily exist for debugging purposes. Actor names and other
details contained in these metrics are documented only in source code, and we
may change them without notice. Do not rely on specific actor names or metrics
in production systems.

:::warning[Deprecation Notice]
Operator metrics are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use
[pipeline metrics](#tenzirmetricspipeline) instead. While they offered great
insight into the performance of operators, they were not as useful as pipeline
metrics for understanding the overall performance of a pipeline, and were too
expensive to collect and store.
