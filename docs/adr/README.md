# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) that capture
notable design choices in the Tenzir code base. ADRs follow a simple numeric
sequence (`NNNN-title.md`) so they can be referenced unambiguously in code
reviews and future documentation.

When you introduce a decision whose context or rationale is not obvious from
the diff alone, add a new ADR by copying the template from an existing record,
incrementing the number, and updating the index below.
