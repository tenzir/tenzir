Computes the bit-wise NOT of its argument.

```tql
bit_not(x:number) -> number
```

## Description

The `bit_not` function computes the bit-wise NOT of `x`. The operation inverts
each bit in the binary representation of the number.

### `x: number`

The number to perform bit-wise NOT on.

## Examples

### Perform bit-wise NOT on an integer

```tql
from {x: bit_not(5)}
```

```tql
{x: -6}
```
