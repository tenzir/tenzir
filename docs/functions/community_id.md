---

Computes the Community ID for a network connection/flow.

```tql
community_id(src_ip=ip, dst_ip=ip, proto=string,
             [src_port=int, dst_port=int, seed=int]) -> str
```

## Description

The `community_id` function computes a unique hash digest of a network
connection according to the [Community
ID](https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec)
spec. The digest is useful for pivoting between multiple events that belong to
the same connection.

The `src_ip` and `dst_ip` parameters are required. The `proto` string is also required and must be `tcp`, `udp`, `icmp` or `icmp6`. `src_port` and `dst_port` may only be specified if the other one is. `seed` can be used to set the initial hashing seed.

## Examples

### Compute a Community ID from a flow 5-tuple

```tql
from {
  x: community_id(src_ip=1.2.3.4, src_port=4584, dst_ip=43.3.132.3,
                  dst_port=3483, proto="tcp")
}
```

```tql
{x: "1:koNcqhFRD5kb254ZrLsdv630jCM="}
```

### Compute a Community ID from a host pair

Because source and destination port are optional, it suffices to provide two IP
addreses to compute a valid Community ID.

```tql
from {x: community_id(src_ip=1.2.3.4, dst_ip=43.3.132.3, proto="udp")}
```

```tql
{x: "1:7TrrMeH98PrUKC0ySu3RNmpUr48="}
```
