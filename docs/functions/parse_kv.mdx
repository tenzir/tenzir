Parses a string as key-value pairs.

```tql
parse_kv(input:string, [field_split=string, value_split=string, quotes=string,
         schema=string, selector=string, schema_only=bool,
         raw=bool, unflatten_separator=string]) -> record
```

## Description

The `parse_kv` function parses a string as key-value pairs.

The string is first split into fields according to `field_split`. This
can be a regular expression. For example, the input `foo: bar, baz: 42` can be
split into `foo: bar` and `baz: 42` with the regular expression `r",\s*"`
(a comma, followed by any amount of whitespace) as the field splitter.
Note that the matched separators are removed when splitting a string.

Afterwards, the extracted fields are split into their key and value by
`value_split`, which can again be a regular expression. In our example,
`r":\s*"` could be used to split `foo: bar` into the key `foo` and its value
`bar`, and similarly `baz: 42` into `baz` and `42`. The result would thus be
`{"foo": "bar", "baz": 42}`. If the regex matches multiple substrings, only the
first match is used.

The supported regular expression syntax is
[RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). In particular, this means that
lookahead `(?=...)` and lookbehind `(?<=...)` are not supported by `parse_kv`
at the moment. However, if the regular expression has a capture group, it is assumed
that only the content of the capture group shall be used as the separator. This
means that unsupported regular expressions such as `(?=foo)bar(?<=baz)` can be
effectively expressed as `foo(bar)baz` instead.

### Quoted Values

The parser is aware of double-quotes (`"`). If the `field_split` or
`value_split` are found within enclosing quotes, they are not considered
matches. This means that both the key and the value may be enclosed in
double-quotes.

For example, given `field_split` `\s*,\s*` and `value_split` `=`, the input

```
"key"="nested = value",key2="value, and more"
```
will parse as
```tql
{
  key: "nested = value",
  key2: "value, and more",
}
```

### `input: string`

The string to parse.

### `field_split = string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate individual fields.

Defaults to `r"\s"`.

### `value_split = string (optional)`

The regular expression used to separate a key from its value.

Defaults to `"="`.

### `quotes = string (optional)`

A string of not escaped characters that are supposed to be considered as quotes.

Defaults to the characters `"'`.

## Examples

### Parse comma-separated key-value pairs

```tql
from {
  input: "surname: John, family_name: Smith, date_of_birth: 1995-05-26"
}
output = input.parse_kv(field_split=r"\s*,\s*", value_split=r"\s*:\s*")
```

```tql
{
  input: "surname: John, family_name: Smith, date_of_birth: 1995-05-26",
  output: {
    surname: "John",
    family_name: "Smith",
    date_of_birth: 1995-05-26,
  },
}
```
