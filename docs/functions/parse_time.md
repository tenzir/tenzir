Parses a time from a string that follows a specific format.

```tql
parse_time(input: string, format: string) -> time
```

## Description

The `parse_time` function matches the given `input` string against the `format` to construct a timestamp.

### `input: string`

The input string from which the timestamp should be extracted.

### `format: string`

The string that specifies the format of `input`, for example `"%m-%d-%Y"`. The
allowed format specifiers are the same as for `strptime(3)`:
