title: "Add `from_file` operator"
type: feature
authors: jachris

The new `from_file` operator can be used to read multiple files from a
potentially remote filesystem using globbing expressions. It also supports
watching for new files and deletion after a file has been read.

`read_lines` now has an additional `binary=true` option which should be used if
the incoming byte stream is not valid UTF-8.
