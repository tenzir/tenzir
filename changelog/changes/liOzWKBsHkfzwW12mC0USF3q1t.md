VAST has new a `store_plugin` type for custom store backends that hold the raw
data of a partition. The new setting `vast.store-backend` controls the
selection of the store implementation, which has a default value is
`segment-store`. This is still an opt-in feature: unless the configuration
value is set, VAST defaults to the old implementation.
