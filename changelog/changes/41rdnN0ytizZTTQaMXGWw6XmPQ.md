Concepts are now supported in more places than just the `where` operator: All
operators and concepts that reference fields in events now support them
transparently. For example, it is not possible to enrich with a lookup table
against all source IP addresses defined in the concept `net.src.ip`, or to group
by destination ports across different schemas with the concept `net.dst.port`.
