title: "Precise Parsing"
type: change

The JSON parser's `--precise` option is now deprecated, as the "precise" mode
is the new default. Use `--merge` to get the previous "imprecise" behavior.

The JSON parser's `--no-infer` option has been renamed to `--schema-only`. The
old name is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
