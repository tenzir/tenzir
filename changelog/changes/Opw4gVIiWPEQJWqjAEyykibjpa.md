We removed the frontend prototype bundled with the web plugin Some parts of the
frontend that we have in development are designed to be closed-source, and it is
easier to develop at the current development stage in a single repository that
is not bound to the release process of VAST itself. An open-source version of
the frontend may return in the future.
