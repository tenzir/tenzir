The new option `import.read-timeout` allows for setting an input timeout for low
volume sources. Reaching the timeout causes the current batch to be forwarded
immediately. This behavior was previously controlled by `import.batch-timeout`,
which now only controls the maximum buffer time before the source forwards
batches to the server.
