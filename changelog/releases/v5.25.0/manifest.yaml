intro: >-
  This release adds periodic emission to the summarize operator, enabling real-time
  streaming analytics with configurable intervals and accumulation modes. It also
  introduces AWS IAM authentication across SQS, S3, and Kafka operators, and fixes
  memory instability in from_http when used with slow downstream consumers.
