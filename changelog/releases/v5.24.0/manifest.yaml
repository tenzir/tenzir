intro: >-
  This release adds XML parsing functions (`parse_xml` and `parse_winlog`) for analyzing
  XML-formatted logs including Windows Event Logs. It also introduces the `parallel`
  operator for parallel pipeline execution, fixes a socket leak in `from_http` that
  could cause resource exhaustion, and includes several stability fixes for gRPC operators
  and the pipeline API.
