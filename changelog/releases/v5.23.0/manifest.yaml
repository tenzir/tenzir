title: Tenzir Node v5.23.0
intro: >-
  This release introduces centralized node-level TLS configuration, allowing you to
  configure TLS settings once in tenzir.yaml instead of passing options to each operator
  individually. It also adds support for event-timestamp-based compaction rules and
  a count field in the deduplicate operator.
