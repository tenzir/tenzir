title: "Enhanced UDP Source"
intro: |
  This release enhances UDP ingestion with the new `from_udp` operator that produces structured events with sender metadata. We also improved the execution model for `every` and `cron` subpipelines, added DNS lookup capabilities, and made the Syslog parser more flexible.
