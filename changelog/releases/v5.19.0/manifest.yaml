title: "OCSF Casting & Recursion"
intro: |
  This release introduces the `ocsf::cast` operator to streamline schema transformations for OCSF events and adds support for one-level recursion in OCSF objects, enabling recursive relations such as `process.parent_process` and `analytic.related_analytics`.
