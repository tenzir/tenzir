title: "Lambda Captures"
description: "This release enhances TQL's data transformation capabilities with lambda expressions that can capture surrounding fields in `map` and `where` functions, plus grouped enumeration for separate event counting. We've also improved operator composability with enhanced `to_splunk` parameters, added octet counting support for syslog messages, and fixed critical issues in Kafka message handling and HTTP request processing."
