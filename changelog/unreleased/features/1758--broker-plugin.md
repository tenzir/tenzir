The new [Broker](https://github.com/zeek/broker) plugin enables seamless log
ingestion from [Zeek](https://github.com/zeek/zeek) to VAST via a TCP socket.
Broker is Zeek's messaging library and the plugin turns VAST into a Zeek [logger
node](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/cluster.html#logger).
