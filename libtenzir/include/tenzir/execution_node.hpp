/// Spawns and monitors an execution node for the given operator and a known
/// input type.
///
/// The execution node sits at the very core of Tenzir's pipeline execution. It
/// provides an actor-based abstraction of a single operator in a pipeline.
///
/// The execution follows the Volcano model, with some small tweaks:
/// - Every execution node with an upstream oeprator has an inbound buffer.
/// - Every execution node with a downstream operator has an outbound buffer.
/// - Starting an execution node primes its generator. This corresponds to the
///   Volcano model's _open_ function.
/// - Execution nodes to fill the outbound and inbound buffers eagerly. To this
///   end, operators with an upstream operator request demand from the previous
///   execution node. Execution nodes respond to demand by requesting a set of
///   results that matches the demand to be accepted by the execution node that
///   generated the demand. Once the result set is accepted, the demand request
///   is responded to. This corresponds to the Volcano model's _next_ function.
/// - Graceful shutdowns propagate downstream once the outbound buffer is empty.
///   Ungraceful shutdowns propagate downstream immediately. Starting an
///   execution node advances the operator's generator up to the first element
///   it can yield. This corresponds to the Volcano model's _close_ function.
/// - Yielding from an operator's generator is guaranteed to return control to
///   the scheduler before the generator is resumed.
/// - Execution nodes are guaranteed to be started right-to-left in the
///   pipeline, and should be spawned left-to-right by the pipeline executor.
///
/// @param self The actor that spawns and monitors the execution node.
/// @param op The operator to execute.
/// @param input_type The input type to assume for the operator.
/// @param definition The top-most definition of this pipeline for use in
/// diagnostics.
/// @param node The node actor to expose in the control plane. Must be set if
/// the operator runs at a remote node.
/// @param diagnostics_handler The handler asked to spawn diagnostics.
/// @param metrices_receiver The handler asked to receive and forward metrics.
/// @param has_terminal True if the operator shall have access to the terminal.
