# Build from source

Tenzir uses [CMake](https://cmake.org) as build system. Aside from a modern C++23
compiler, you need to ensure availability of the dependencies in the table
below.

:::tip Deterministic Builds via Nix
We provide a Nix flake to setup an environment in which all dependencies are
available. Run `nix develop` inside the main source directory. You can also
delegate the entire build process to Nix by invoking `nix build`, but be aware
that this method does not support incremental
builds.
:::

## Dependencies

Every [release](https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir/releases) of Tenzir includes an
[SBOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bill_of_materials) in
[SPDX](https://spdx.dev) format that lists all dependencies and their versions.

The minimum specified versions reflect those versions that we use in CI and
manual testing. Older versions may still work in select cases.

:::tip macOS
On macOS, we recommend using Clang from the Homebrew `llvm@20` package with the
following settings:

```bash
export LLVM_PREFIX="$(brew --prefix llvm@20)"
export PATH="${LLVM_PREFIX}/bin:${PATH}"
export CC="${LLVM_PREFIX}/bin/clang"
export CXX="${LLVM_PREFIX}/bin/clang++"
export LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,${LLVM_PREFIX} ${LDFLAGS}"
export CPPFLAGS="-isystem ${LLVM_PREFIX}/include ${CPPFLAGS}"
export CXXFLAGS="-isystem ${LLVM_PREFIX}/include/c++/v1 ${CXXFLAGS}"
```

Installing via CMake on macOS configures a [launchd](https://www.launchd.info)
agent to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tenzir.tenzir.plist`. Use `launchctl` to
spawn a node at login:

```bash
# To unload the agent, replace 'load' with 'unload'.
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.tenzir.tenzir.plist
```
:::

## Compile

Building Tenzir involves the following steps:

Clone the repository recursively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tenzir/tenzir
cd tenzir
git submodule update --init --recursive -- libtenzir plugins
```

Configure the build with CMake. For faster builds, we recommend passing
`-G Ninja` to `cmake`.

```bash
cmake -B build
# CMake defaults to a "Debug" build. When performance matters, use "Release"
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```

Optionally, you can use the CMake TUI to visually configure the build:

```bash
ccmake build
```

The source tree also contains a set of CMake presets that combine various
configuration options into curated build flavors. You can list them with:

```bash
cmake --list-presets
```

Build the executable:

```bash
cmake --build build --target all
```

## Test

After you have built the executable, run the unit and integration tests to
verify that your build works as expected:

Run component-level unit tests:

```bash
ctest --test-dir build
```

Run end-to-end integration tests:

```bash
cmake --build build --target bats
```

## Install

Install Tenzir system-wide:

```bash
cmake --install build
```

If you prefer to install into a custom install prefix, install with `--prefix
/path/to/install/prefix`.

To remove debug symbols from the installed binaries and libraries, pass
`--strip`.

To install only files relevant for running Tenzir and not for plugin development
pass `--component Runtime`.

## Clean

In case you want to make changes to your build environment, we recommend
deleting the build tree entirely:

```bash
rm -rf build
```

This avoids subtle configuration glitches of transitive dependencies. For
example, CMake doesn't disable assertions when switching from a `Debug` to
a `Release` build, but would do so when starting with a fresh build of type
`Release`.
