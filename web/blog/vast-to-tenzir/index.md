After 5 years of developing two identities, the VAST project and Tenzir
the company, we decided to streamline our efforts and **rename VAST to Tenzir**.

<!--truncate-->

VAST is the open-source software project Tenzir's Founder and CEO, Matthias
Vallentin, created originally during his Master's at Technical University Munich
in 2006, and then continued to work on throughout his PhD from 2008 to 2016 at
the University of California, Berkeley. The name is an acronym for Visibility
Across Space and Time and originates from the HotSec'08 paper about [Principles
for Developing Comprehensive Network
Visibility](https://www.icir.org/mallman/papers/awareness-hotsec08.pdf) by Mark
Allman, Christian Kreibich, Vern Paxson, Robin Sommer, and Nicholas Weaver.

The following reasons ultimately drove our decision to rename VAST:

- **Building two brands is double the effort**: we found that building two
  brands—one for the VAST project and one for Tenzir as a company—is a challenge
  for an early-stage startup like ourselves.
- **Taking a broader view when it comes to open source**: we also don't see our
  enterprise and open-source users as separate and isolated groupings. Instead
  we see a continuum. So we want to put all of our energy into a single, unified
  community.
- **Avoiding confusion and conflicts**: over the past years the term VAST has
  become very popular and widely used for a number of different projects and in
  adjacent industries (VAST Data, VAST.ai, anyone?) to avoid existing or future
  confusion we decided that it was better to retire the name but keep it part of
  our legacy and our story.

Our next release will be Tenzir v4.0, continuing from the VAST v3.x series. In
other respects as well, the transition is an evolution, not a revolution. All
project-related infrastructure, including the SemVer versioning, Git history,
GitHub repository, and so forth will remain the same. Stay tuned for a follow-up
blog post where we discuss the technical changes in depth and provide migration
instructions.

Oh, and if you have any nostalgic anecdotes or stories to share, we'd love to
