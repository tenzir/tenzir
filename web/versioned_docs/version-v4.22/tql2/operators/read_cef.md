# read_cef

Parses an incoming [Common Event Format (CEF)][cef] stream into events.

```tql
read_cef [merge=bool, raw=bool, schema=str, selector=str, schema_only=bool, unflatten=str]
```

## Description

The [Common Event Format (CEF)][cef] is a text-based event format that
originally stems from ArcSight. It is line-based and human readable. The first 7
fields of a CEF event are always the same, and the 8th *extension* field is an
optional list of key-value pairs:

[cef]: https://community.microfocus.com/cfs-file/__key/communityserver-wikis-components-files/00-00-00-00-23/3731.CommonEventFormatV25.pdf

```
CEF:Version|Device Vendor|Device Product|Device Version|Device Event Class ID|Name|Severity|[Extension]
```

Here is a real-world example:

```

```

The [CEF specification][cef] pre-defines several extension field key names and
data types for the corresponding values. Tenzir's parser does not enforce the
strict definitions and instead tries to infer the type from the provided values.

Tenzir translates the `extension` field to a nested record, where the key-value
pairs of the extensions map to record fields. Here is an example of the above
event:

```json title="Output (shortened)"
{
  "cef_version": 0,
  "device_vendor": "Cynet",
  "device_product": "Cynet 360",
  "device_version": "4.5.4.22139",
  "signature_id": "0",
  "name": "Memory Pattern - Cobalt Strike Beacon ReflectiveLoader",
  "severity": "8",
  "extension": {
    "externalId": 6,
    "clientId": 2251997,
    "scanGroupId": 3,
    ...
    "gpssdeep": "384:YtOYTIcNkWE9GHAoGLcVB5QGaRW5SmgydKz3fvnJYunOTBbsMoMH3nxENoWlymW:YLTVNkzGgoG+5BSmUfvJMdsq3xYu",
    "gpSign": "Signed",
    "actRem": "Kill, Rename"
  }
}
```

### `merge = bool (optional)`

Merges all incoming events into a single schema\* that converges over time. This
option is may be faster for reading *highly heterogeneous* data,
but can lead to huge schemas filled with nulls and imprecise results.
Use with caution.

\*: In selector mode, only events with the same selector are merged.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw types that are native to the parsed format. Fields that have a type
specified in the chosen `schema` will still be parsed according to the schema.

In the case of CEF, this means that no parsing of data takes place at all
and every value remains a string, unless the field is in the `schema`.

### `schema = str (optional)`

Provide the name of a [schema](../../data-model/schemas.md) to be used by the
parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have
all fields from that schema.
* Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will be null.
* Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept. `schema_only=true`
can be used to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = str (optional)`

Designates a field value as [schema](../../data-model/schemas.md) name with an
optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and
will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field
`event_type` that contains the event type. Setting the selector to
`event_type:suricata` causes an event with the value `flow` for the field
`event_type` to map onto the schema `suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

### `schema_only = bool (optional)`

When working with an existing schema (obtained via the `schema` or `selector` option), this option will ensure that the output
schema has *only* the fields from that schema. If the schema name is obtained
via a `selector`
and it does not exist, this has no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten = str (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of
nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](read_zeek_json.md) format.
It includes the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and `id.resp_p`
at the top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with four nested
fields `orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

```json title="Without unflattening"
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

```json title="With 'unflatten'"
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```
