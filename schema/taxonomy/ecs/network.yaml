- concept:
    name: ecs.network.name
    description: >
      Name given by operators to sections of their network.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.type
    description: >
      In the OSI Model this would be the Network Layer. ipv4, ipv6, ipsec,
      pim, etc

      The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
      documentation section "Implementing ECS".
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.iana_number
    description: >
      IANA Protocol Number (https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).
      Standardized list of protocols. This aligns well with NetFlow and sFlow
      related logs which use the IANA Protocol Number.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.transport
    description: >
      Same as network.iana_number, but instead using the Keyword name of the
      transport layer (udp, tcp, ipv6-icmp, etc.)

      The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
      documentation section "Implementing ECS".
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.application
    description: >
      A name given to an application level protocol. This can be arbitrarily
      assigned for things like microservices, but also apply to things like
      skype, icq, facebook, twitter. This would be used in situations where
      the vendor or service can be decoded such as from the source/dest IP
      owners, ports, or wire format.

      The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
      documentation section "Implementing ECS".
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.protocol
    description: >
      L7 Network protocol name. ex. http, lumberjack, transport protocol.

      The field value must be normalized to lowercase for querying. See the
      documentation section "Implementing ECS".
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.direction
    description: >
      Direction of the network traffic.

      Recommended values are:
        * ingress
        * egress
        * inbound
        * outbound
        * internal
        * external
        * unknown

      When mapping events from a host-based monitoring context, populate this
      field from the host's point of view, using the values "ingress" or "egress".

      When mapping events from a network or perimeter-based monitoring context,
      populate this field from the point of view of the network perimeter,
      using the values "inbound", "outbound", "internal" or "external".

      Note that "internal" is not crossing perimeter boundaries, and is meant
      to describe communication between two hosts within the perimeter. Note
      also that "external" is meant to describe traffic between two hosts
      that are external to the perimeter. This could for example be useful
      for ISPs or VPN service providers.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.forwarded_ip
    description: >
      Host IP address when the source IP address is the proxy.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.community_id
    description: >
      A hash of source and destination IPs and ports, as well as the protocol
      used in a communication. This is a tool-agnostic standard to identify
      flows.

- concept:
    name: ecs.network.bytes
    description: >
      Total bytes transferred in both directions.

      If `source.bytes` and `destination.bytes` are known, `network.bytes`
      is their sum.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.packets
    description: >
      Total packets transferred in both directions.

      If `source.packets` and `destination.packets` are known, `network.packets`
      is their sum.
- concept:
    name: ecs.network.inner
    description: >
      Network.inner fields are added in addition to network.vlan fields to
      describe the innermost VLAN when q-in-q VLAN tagging is present. Allowed
      fields include vlan.id and vlan.name. Inner vlan fields are typically
      used when sending traffic with multiple 802.1q encapsulations to a network
      sensor (e.g. Zeek, Wireshark.)
